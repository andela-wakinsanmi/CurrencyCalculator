# CurrencyCalculator

##About the App

This is a monetary calculator that allows user to view convertion rate from Currency to another currency on the fly. The Application fetches and updates the Latest Currency when you start the Application on your phone. If there is no internet, the Application loads the last updated value from the database. 

The Application also lets users make basic calculation. For instance, You may have a $200, £500 and €300 and you want to know the equivalent in ₦. This Application allows you to add all the currencies together and get the ₦ equivalent.

User can also switch between Currency and Calculator Mode. Meanwhile, if a user selects same input and output on the Spinner, the Application is smart enough to switch the user into Calculator mode.
